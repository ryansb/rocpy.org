          RocPy is Rochester's finest (and only) Python user group. We strive
          to get work done in Python. We're here to give others the opportunity
          to meet and work with other Python developers/enthusiasts.

        %p
          We meet monthly, and our schedule can be found on
          %a{:href => "http://meetup.com/Rochester-Python-Meetup/"} Meetup.
          Presentations typically last 45-60 minutes and are followed by some
          discussion.

        %p
          We eventually plan to also hold lightning talks before or after
          meetings so people can give talks in less depth.
